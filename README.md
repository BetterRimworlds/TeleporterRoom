# Rimworld Dematerializer

![Atlantean Teleporter Room](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BetterRimworlds/TeleporterRoom/trunk/TeleporterRoom/About/Preview.png)

The Teleporter Room allows you to teleport materials and pawns on the current map directly into another 
Teleporter Room, anywhere on the Planet.

When solar storms occur, the Teleporter Room is fully powered by the solar wind.

Conditions for a functional Teleporter Room:

1. It must be placed in a room that is at least 6x6 to fully fit the Teleporter.
2. The Room must not be bigger than 12x24 (288 cells).
3. The Room must be completely surrounded by Plasteel walls and doors, to facilitate the Zero-Point Energy transfer.
4. The Room must be completely roofed. No unroofed tiles.
5. The Room's floor must be completely covered in Sterile Tiles.
6. All requirements also apply for the remote Teleporter Room, as well.
